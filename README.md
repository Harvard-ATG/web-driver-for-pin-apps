###Project Summary
This repository contains basic code using the Selenium WebDriver API that will use automated testing to test a Harvard PIN-enabled web application.

###Requirements 
You must have first installed the Selenium WebDriver API.  This is as simple as downloading the freely available .jar file into your classpath.

###Running this code
This code will take an XID and PIN (or an HUID and password, but be careful not to leave these lying around where someone could get them...) as command line arguments, will fire-up an instance of Firefox and log into my.harvard, search the Course Planner on the keyword "Byzantine" and will then take a screenshot of the result.
